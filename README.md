# SYN Messenger for Android

SYN Messenger is a privacy-focused [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) client for Android, maintained by Hawthorn LLC.

This project is derived from [Element X Android](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android) and continues to use the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose. Element and Element X are trademarks of their respective owners; SYN Messenger is an independent project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Element.

Compared to the previous-generation [Element Classic](https://github.com/element-hq/element-android), the application is a total rewrite, using the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) underneath and targeting devices running Android 7+. The UI layer is written using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), and the navigation is managed using [Appyx](https://github.com/bumble-tech/appyx).

## Translations

Element X Android supports many languages. You can help us to translate the app in your language by joining our [Localazy project](https://localazy.com/p/element). You can also help us to improve the existing translations.

Note that for now, we keep control on the French and German translations.

Translations can be checked screen per screen using our tool Element X Android Gallery, available at https://element-hq.github.io/element-x-android/. Note that this page is updated every Tuesday.

More instructions about translating the application can be found at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#strings).

## Rust SDK

Element X leverages the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) through an FFI layer that the final client can directly import and use.

We're doing this as a way to share code between platforms and while we've seen promising results it's still in the experimental stage and bound to change.

## Status

This project is actively developed and supported. New users are recommended to use Element X instead of the previous-generation app.

## Minimum SDK version

Element X Android requires a minimum SDK version of 24 (Android 7.0, Nougat). We aim to support devices running Android 7.0 and above, which covers a wide range of devices still in use today.

Element Android Enterprise requires a minimum SDK version of 33 (Android 13, Tiramisu). For Element Enterprise, we support only devices that still receive security updates, which means devices running Android 13 and above. Android does not have a documented support policy, but some information can be found at [https://endoflife.date/android](https://endoflife.date/android).

## Contributing

Want to get actively involved in the project? You're more than welcome! A good way to start is to check the issues that are labelled with the [good first issue](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label. Let us know by commenting the issue that you're starting working on it.

But first make sure to read our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

You can also come chat with the community in the Matrix [room](https://matrix.to/#/#element-x-android:matrix.org) dedicated to the project.

## Build instructions

Just clone the project and open it in Android Studio. Make sure to select the
`app` configuration when building (as we also have sample apps in the project).

To build against a local copy of the Rust SDK, see the [Developer
onboarding](docs/_developer_onboarding.md#building-the-sdk-locally) instructions.

## Support

When you are experiencing an issue on Element X Android, please first search in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/issues)
and then in [#element-x-android:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-x-android:matrix.org).
If after your research you still have a question, ask at [#element-x-android:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-x-android:matrix.org). Otherwise feel free to create a GitHub issue if you encounter a bug or a crash, by explaining clearly in detail what happened. You can also perform bug reporting from the application settings. This is especially recommended when you encounter a crash.
